If you want to create your own picture frames, using a miter saw is an efficient and precise method. In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of cutting picture frames using a miter saw. By following these instructions, you will be able to create beautiful frames with ease.\nKey Points: Start by cutting the routed profile and rabbet. Measure 14.5 inches from one end of the wood and make a cut. Cut with the profile and rabbet facing towards the fence. Keep the short and long pieces organized to avoid mixing them up. Rotate the saw to a 45-degree angle. Use a stop block to ensure the wood doesn’t slide while making angled cuts. Make slow and controlled cuts to avoid a rough surface. Repeat the 45-degree angle cuts on all four pieces. Move the stop block approximately two inches and repeat the cutting process. Flip the pieces over so that the rabbet is facing up. Measure from the corner and make a cut to accommodate the picture. Use a stop block to align the piece and prevent sliding. Hold the flat part of the project against the fence for stability. Repeat the process for the remaining long piece. Measure 8 and 1/8 inches for the final cut. Dry fit the pieces together to ensure a tight fit. Glue the pieces together for a secure and durable frame. Step-by-Step Guide: Cutting the routed profile and rabbet: Before starting the cutting process, make sure you have the routed profile and rabbet already cut on the wood. These are crucial for creating a proper picture frame.\nMarking and making the first cut: Measure 14.5 inches from one end of the wood and mark it. Ensure that the mark is on the correct side, as it may appear reversed. Cut the wood on the marked spot, making sure the profile and rabbet are facing towards the fence.\nKeeping pieces organized: Separate the wood into short and long pieces. The short ones will be used for the eight-inch end, while the long ones will be used for the ten-inch end. Keep these pieces organized to avoid any mix-ups during the assembly process.\nSetting up the stop block for angled cuts: Rotate the saw to a 45-degree angle and adjust the stop block to prevent the wood from sliding while making angled cuts. This is crucial, as wood tends to move to the left during angled cuts.\nMaking controlled cuts: Hold the wood securely with your left hand and guide it slowly into the saw blade. Avoid rushing the cutting process, as it can result in a rough surface that won’t be strong when glued. This is especially important when cutting towards the end of the wood, as the blade cuts upwards at that point.\nRepeating the 45-degree cuts: Repeat the angled cuts on all four pieces of wood. Ensure that the cuts are consistent and precise to achieve uniformity in the final frame.\nAdjusting the stop block and flipping the wood: Move the stop block approximately two inches and flip the wood over so that the rabbet is facing up. This will allow for accurate measurements and ensure that the picture fits within the frame.\nMeasuring and making the final cut: Measure 8 and 1/8 inches from the corner and mark it on one piece of wood. Since the stop block helps maintain consistency, you only need to mark one piece. This measurement ensures that there is enough space for the picture to fit within the frame. Make the cut, aligning it with the stop block for precision.\nHolding the wood securely for the final cut: Hold the wood flat against the fence, ensuring stability and accuracy in the cut. Use the wide end of the stop block to prevent the piece from sliding during the cutting process.\nRepeating the process for the remaining long piece: Repeat the measurement and cutting process on the other long piece of wood. The end result should be two long pieces of the same length.\nDry fitting and gluing the frame: Before gluing the pieces together, perform a dry fit to ensure everything aligns properly. Once satisfied, carefully apply glue to the joints and assemble the frame. Use clamps or straps to hold the frame tightly together until the glue dries completely.\nBy following these step-by-step instructions, you can effectively use a miter saw to cut picture frames with precision and accuracy. Whether you are a DIY enthusiast or a professional, this method will help you create stunning frames for your favorite photographs or artworks. Enjoy the process and showcase your creativity with beautifully crafted picture frames.\nRemember, safety is of utmost importance when using power tools. Always wear appropriate protective gear and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for safe operation.\n","wordCount":"811","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom Harding"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/metal-picture-frame-miter-saw/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Cut Picture Frames with a Miter Saw: Step-by-Step Guide</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 25, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;811 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tom Harding</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#key-points>Key Points:</a></li><li><a href=#step-by-step-guide>Step-by-Step Guide:</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3vJYC_B3zg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Picture frames can add a touch of elegance and style to any photograph or artwork.
