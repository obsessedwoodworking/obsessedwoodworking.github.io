Many times, due to various reasons such as weather delays, permitting issues, or waiting for a contractor, project timelines get extended, and it becomes necessary to store the building materials temporarily. One common method to protect these materials is by tarping them up. We will outline the key steps to safeguarding your investment and ensure that your lumber remains in excellent condition for future use.\nKey Points Use Dunnage for Elevation: When storing lumber outside, it is essential to keep it off the ground to prevent moisture absorption. Placing dunnage, which refers to blocks or supports, underneath the wood will provide the necessary elevation, allowing air circulation and minimizing contact with the ground.\nLeave the Straps On: It is advisable to keep the straps on the lumber to prevent twisting and warping. By securing the lumber together with the straps, you maintain its structural integrity and ensure it remains in the desired shape.\nTarps for Protection: Covering the lumber with a tarp is a crucial step to shield it from adverse weather conditions. This is especially important during extended storage periods. A well-tarped stack of lumber can protect against moisture, direct sunlight, and other damaging elements.\nAllow Airflow: While tarping the lumber provides protection, it is equally important to allow proper airflow. By elevating the lumber and leaving gaps between the tarped bundles, you facilitate air circulation, preventing the formation of mold or mildew.\nInspection Techniques: If you are concerned about potential hidden damage within the lumber stack, it is recommended to inspect it thoroughly. Breaking the bands or straps can allow for a closer examination of individual pieces. Metal clips can often be undone and reused, but if cutting the bands is necessary, using ratchet straps provides an effective alternative to secure the stack tightly.\nReusable Ratchet Straps: When handling lumber stacks that require re-strapping, ratchet straps are a convenient solution. Simply tighten the strap using a ratchet, ensuring a secure bind. This method helps maintain the original integrity of the stack and prevents warping or twisting during storage.\nThe Importance of Proper Storage Properly storing kiln-dried construction lumber outside is essential to protect your investment and ensure that it remains in excellent condition. Moisture is one of the biggest threats to lumber, as it can lead to warping, twisting, and rotting. By following the steps outlined above, you can mitigate these risks and keep your lumber ready for use when you are ready to proceed with your project.\nElevating the lumber using dunnage provides crucial separation between the wood and the ground. This prevents moisture from seeping into the lumber, preserving its quality. Additionally, leaving the straps on the lumber stack helps maintain its structural integrity. By preventing twisting and warping, the lumber remains straight and true, ready to be incorporated into your construction.\nThe strategic use of tarps further protects the lumber from the elements. Covering the stack ensures that rain, snow, and direct sunlight do not adversely affect the woodâ€™s condition. However, it is important to balance protection with proper airflow. Allowing air to circulate through the stack prevents the accumulation of moisture and reduces the risk of mold or mildew formation.\nInspecting Your Lumber Stack It is natural to be concerned about potential hidden damage within the lumber stack, especially when it has been stored for extended periods. To ensure that the wood is in good condition before using it, a thorough inspection is necessary.\nOne effective method is to break the bands or straps that hold the lumber together. This allows you to carefully examine each piece, checking for signs of damage, such as cracks or splitting. In some cases, you might come across metal clips that can be undone and reused, simplifying the inspection process.\nHowever, if you need to cut the bands and cannot re-strap them tightly, ratchet straps offer a practical alternative. By using a ratchet strap, you can secure the lumber stack, keeping it tightly bound together. This method helps prevent any warping or twisting that may occur during storage, ensuring that your lumber remains in optimal condition.\nConclusion In conclusion, properly storing kiln-dried construction lumber outside is crucial to protect your investment and ensure that it remains in top condition. By utilizing dunnage to elevate the wood, leaving the straps on to maintain structural integrity, and tarping the stack for weather protection, you can safeguard your lumber from moisture and other damaging elements.\nRemember to allow proper airflow to prevent mold or mildew formation and to inspect the lumber stack thoroughly before use. By following these guidelines, you can store your lumber with confidence, knowing that it will be ready for your construction project when the time comes. Protect your investment and maximize the longevity of your lumber by implementing these essential storage practices.\n","wordCount":"811","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"George Conner"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/storing-kiln-dried-construction-lumber-outside/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Storing Kiln Dried Construction Lumber Outside: Tips for Protecting Your Investment</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 21, 2023</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;811 words&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;George Conner</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#key-points>Key Points</a></li><li><a href=#the-importance-of-proper-storage>The Importance of Proper Storage</a></li><li><a href=#inspecting-your-lumber-stack>Inspecting Your Lumber Stack</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/T7fqeW7Aw-0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will discuss the importance of properly storing kiln-dried construction lumber outside.
