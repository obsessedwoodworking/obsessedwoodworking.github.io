However, there is a solution that allows you to use any brand battery in any power tool, regardless of the brand. With the use of simple adapters, you can expand the compatibility of your power tools and save money in the process. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using battery adapters and how they can revolutionize the way you use your power tools.\nImagine being able to have a Makita tool running on a DEWALT battery, or a DEWALT tool powered by a Makita battery. The possibilities are endless when you have the right adapters. These adapters are small, adding only a few inches to the length of your tool, but they open up a world of compatibility. You can mix and match different brands of tools and batteries to create a customized setup that suits your needs.\nOne common scenario is when you have already invested in a particular battery platform and don’t want to switch to a different brand. Maybe you are a fan of the yellow DEWALT tools and don’t want to give them up. However, you see a tool from another brand that would make your job easier, but you don’t want to invest in another set of batteries and chargers. Battery adapters eliminate this dilemma. You can simply purchase an adapter and use your existing batteries with the new tool.\nFor example, let’s say you have a Porter Cable grinder that you love, but it’s not brushless and it drains batteries quickly. Instead of buying a new tool and investing in a new battery platform, you can use a battery adapter to power it with a Makita battery. The tool will function just as it should, with the added benefit of longer battery life and improved efficiency.\nThe versatility of these adapters is truly remarkable. The adapters allow you to use Ryobi tools with DEWALT batteries, Makita tools with Porter Cable batteries, and many other combinations. You can even use adapters to connect multiple brands together. For instance, you can run a Makita tool with a DEWALT battery, or a DEWALT tool with a Makita battery. The choice is yours, and the adapters make it possible.\nTo further showcase the compatibility and performance of battery adapters, a comparison test was conducted. A top-of-the-line brushless Makita grinder was used with various brands of batteries, including Porter Cable, DEWALT, and Ryobi. Despite the different battery brands, all the tools performed with no noticeable difference in power or performance. This test proves that battery adapters do not compromise the functionality of the tools and allow you to use any brand of battery seamlessly.\nBattery adapters are readily available and affordable. They typically cost between $12 and $18, making them a cost-effective solution compared to purchasing new batteries and chargers. You can find these adapters on platforms like Amazon or directly from manufacturers. In the video description, you will find a list of recommended adapters for different brand combinations.\nIt is important to note that while battery adapters cover most major brands such as DEWALT, MILWAUKEE, MAKITA, PORTER CABLE, and BOSCH, they may not be compatible with certain niche brands or models such as Harbor Freight or the 24-volt Cobalt range from Lowe’s. However, for the majority of power tool users, battery adapters provide extensive compatibility options.\nIn conclusion, the use of battery adapters allows you to break free from the constraints of specific battery platforms. You can utilize any brand battery in any power tool, expanding your options and saving money. These adapters are small in size but deliver incredible compatibility. With battery adapters, you can mix and match tools and batteries, creating a versatile and customized setup tailored to your specific needs. So don’t limit yourself to one battery platform – unlock the potential of your power tools with battery adapters.\nIf you have any questions or want to learn more about battery adapters, feel free to leave a comment below.\n","wordCount":"679","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brenda Adkins"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/cordless-tool-battery-interchangeable/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Use any Brand Battery in Any Power Tool 18V-20V DEWALT MILWAUKEE MAKITA PORTER CABLE BOSCH Adapters</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 24, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;679 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Brenda Adkins</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MMssklzoBAk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>In today&rsquo;s world of power tools, it can be expensive and inconvenient to invest in multiple battery platforms for different tool brands.
