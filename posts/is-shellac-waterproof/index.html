However, modern finish manufacturers have convinced us that shellac is old-fashioned, and many woodworkers have forgotten the benefits of using it. In this article, we will explore why shellac is a great wood finish, how to use it effectively, and when it is the best choice for your projects. By the end of this article, you will understand why shellac can save you days of shop time and why it deserves a place in your woodworking arsenal.\nWhy use shellac as a wood finish? Shellac offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for woodworkers. First and foremost, it is fast and easy to apply. Unlike other finishes, you simply wipe shellac onto the wood surface, making it difficult to mess up. Additionally, shellac has no drying time, allowing you to apply multiple coats in a short amount of time. Completing the entire finishing process can take just a few minutes or a few hours, depending on the size of the project, compared to a few days with other finishes.\nAnother benefit of shellac is its versatility. It adheres well to almost any other finish, and other finishes adhere well to it as long as it is dewaxed. This means that you can use shellac as a base coat under other finishes or as a topcoat over them. It doesn’t matter if the other finish is water-based or oil-based; shellac will still stick to it. This versatility makes shellac an excellent choice for repairs, as it is easy to dissolve and fix any imperfections, even years later.\nShellac is also environmentally friendly, as it is derived from the excretion of the Lac Beetle. It contains no petroleum products and is even used as a food coating. Additionally, shellac has a pleasant smell, making it suitable for use in enclosed spaces like drawers or cabinets. Its various colors, ranging from light blonde to deep brown, allow you to enhance the appearance of different wood types or create custom wood stains by adding aniline dyes.\nWhy isn’t everyone using shellac? Despite its many benefits, shellac is not as widely used as it once was. One reason for this is that shellac does not create a bulletproof, plasticky finish like polyurethane or other modern finishes. It can be durable, especially when used on floors, but it is not the best choice for table tops or surfaces exposed to alcohol, as it can dissolve. Additionally, many people are simply afraid of using shellac because they believe it can be complicated and easy to mess up. However, with a basic understanding of a few key points, using shellac is actually quite simple.\nHow to use shellac effectively To get started with shellac as a wood finish, you have two options: making it from flakes or buying pre-mixed cans. If you choose to make your own, you will need shellac flakes and denatured alcohol. The flakes can be dissolved in alcohol to create the desired consistency. The general rule for mixing is a four-to-one ratio of alcohol volume to flakes weight. However, this can be adjusted based on personal preference.\nIt is important to note that pre-mixed cans of shellac come in different versions, such as “seal coat” and “regular shellac.” Seal coat is extra thin and suitable for deep penetration into wood fibers, making it ideal for preventing stain absorption and blotching. Regular shellac, on the other hand, is more concentrated and may require dilution with alcohol before use. Additionally, seal coat is dewaxed, while regular shellac may contain wax. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of your project.\nWhen purchasing pre-mixed cans, it is crucial to consider their shelf life. Shellac in sealed cans typically lasts for three years, but once opened, its curing time may slow down. Therefore, it is recommended to test the shellac if it has been open for more than six months. This can be done by applying a coat to a piece of wood and checking if it feels tacky for an extended period. If it does, it is advisable to discard the shellac and purchase a fresh batch.\nConclusion In conclusion, shellac is a versatile and eco-friendly wood finish that offers many advantages. Its easy application, quick drying time, compatibility with other finishes, and ability to be repaired make it a valuable tool for woodworkers. Although it may not provide the same level of protection as modern finishes, shellac’s unique qualities make it a worthwhile addition to any woodworking project. Whether you choose to make your own shellac from flakes or purchase pre-mixed cans, understanding the different options and their uses will ensure successful and efficient finishing results. So, why spend days in the shop when you can save time and achieve stunning finishes with shellac? Give it a try and see the difference for yourself.\n","wordCount":"819","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Adolph Lowe"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/is-shellac-waterproof/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>This SIMPLE wood finish will save you DAYS of shop time!
