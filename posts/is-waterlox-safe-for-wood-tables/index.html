People often wonder if the finishes they use on their wooden tables, countertops, and even cutting boards are food-safe. In this article, we will explore the truth behind food-safe wood finishes and debunk some common misconceptions.\nMarketing terms, such as “food-safe,” used by some manufacturers to label their finishes can be misleading. These terms might imply that finishes without such labels are poisonous or unsafe. However, the reality is that all wood finishes available in hardware stores, including natural oils, shellac, and even polyurethane, are food-safe once they fully cure.\nIn the past, some finishes contained lead as a metallic dryer, which raised concerns about their safety. However, lead was banned from wood finishes almost half a century ago. While trace amounts of other metallic dryers, like those found in boiled linseed oil, may still exist, you would have to consume the finish directly from the bottle to experience any significant exposure. The solvents and bonding agents in these finishes either evaporate or bond with oxygen molecules as the finish cures, leaving behind a hardened, food-safe surface.\nThe key is to let the finish fully cure so that harmful solvents are eliminated. Polyurethane, for example, takes approximately a month to cure completely. Other finishes may take less time. You can determine if a finish is cured by touching it and recognizing if you can still smell the finish. If you can, it’s not yet fully cured. Once cured, the finish essentially becomes a plastic-like material, similar to what we use for eating utensils and food containers.\nWhile all wood finishes have the potential to be food-safe, it’s worth considering other options and their pros and cons. Here are some common finishes used for food-related wood products:\nMineral Oil: Mineral oil is safe to consume directly from the bottle, although it functions as a laxative. Once it soaks into the wood, it won’t come off and contaminate your food. It’s suitable for cutting boards that only require light rinsing for cleaning but may not be ideal for bowls or items that will be submerged in water due to its limited water resistance.\nBoiled Linseed Oil: Boiled linseed oil contains chemical and metallic dryers that can be harmful if ingested directly, but it becomes safe after about a month of curing. However, it can darken and even become rancid over time, similar to vegetable oils.\nWalnut Oil: Naturally derived from walnuts, walnut oil is safe for consumption and is often used as a salad dressing. It is suitable for spreading on a salad bowl or other wooden food-related items. However, individuals with severe nut allergies should be cautious, as there is some debate regarding its potential effects.\nTongue Oil: Tongue oil, another oil derived from nuts, doesn’t typically cause allergic reactions. However, some products labeled as tongue oil may contain additional ingredients. It’s essential to read the label and decide based on personal preferences and potential allergens.\nShellac: Made from bug droppings, shellac can be used on cutting boards and similar items. However, it’s not very water-resistant, and it dissolves in alcohol even after curing. If you have alcohol often present in your kitchen, it may not be the best choice for countertops, table tops, or cutting boards.\nPolyurethane: As discussed earlier, polyurethane forms a durable and water-resistant plastic-like finish once cured. It’s safe for food-related items and provides excellent protection against water, grease, and other substances. However, it may not be as easy to maintain or re-coat without substantial sanding.\nWax-Based Finishes: Wax-based finishes, often containing beeswax or carnauba wax mixed with natural oils, are also marketed for food-related wood products. These finishes are safe, provide additional water resistance compared to oils alone, but require regular reapplication.\nPaste Waxes: Paste waxes like Johnson’s and other brands contain solvents like mineral spirits, which evaporate over time. Although safe for countertops that come into contact with food, there are more durable finishes available for items like cutting boards and bowls.\nIt’s important to note that this list does not cover every single wood finish available, such as lacquers and varnishes. While the general rule is that any finish that cures to a hard film is food-safe, it’s always advisable to consult the manufacturer for specific finishes to ensure their safety for food-related applications.\nIn conclusion, when using wood finishes on furniture or kitchen items, it is essential to let the finish fully cure to ensure any harmful solvents evaporate. Once cured, most wood finishes, including polyurethane, are considered food-safe. However, it is crucial to choose a finish that suits your specific needs and preferences, as each type has its advantages and disadvantages. By understanding the properties of different wood finishes, you can make an informed decision and maintain the beauty and safety of your wood tables, countertops, and other food-related wooden items.\n","wordCount":"819","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Kelley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/is-waterlox-safe-for-wood-tables/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Waterlox Safe for Wood Tables?
