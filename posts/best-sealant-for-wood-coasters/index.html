In this article, we will guide you on how to seal your coasters effectively using the best sealant for wood coasters.\nTo ensure your coasters remain durable and resistant to damage, we recommend using a spray-on polyurethane sealant. This type of sealant not only provides a protective barrier but also gives your coasters an attractive clear satin or matte finish.\nBefore starting the sealing process, it’s essential to set up a suitable workspace. Ideally, work outdoors in pleasant weather conditions to ensure proper ventilation. Place your coasters on a piece of scrap wood or use cardboard or drop cloths for larger projects. This will prevent any potential damage to your work surface.\nStart by shaking the spray can vigorously for a few minutes. This helps to ensure that the sealant is thoroughly mixed and ready to use. When spraying the sealant, be sure to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any potential overspray.\nHold the can approximately six to eight inches above the coaster surface. Maintaining this distance will help you achieve a smooth and even coating. Apply the sealant in a sweeping motion, covering the entire surface of each coaster. The goal is to create a thin layer that provides optimal protection without creating a heavy or uneven finish.\nOnce you have finished applying the sealant to one side of the coasters, allow them to dry completely. Polyurethane sealants typically require a few hours to dry, but some formulas may dry even faster. Take advantage of this time to check for any imperfections or bubbles on the surface. If you notice any, quickly wipe them away with a clean rag before the sealant dries completely. It’s crucial to address these issues promptly to ensure a flawless final result.\nAfter the first side has dried, you can flip the coasters over and repeat the sealing process on the other side. However, for the purpose of this guide, we will focus on sealing just one side.\nTake a moment to assess the quality of the sealant application. Ensure that the sealant is not too thick or has any visible bubbles. Smooth out any imperfections that may impact the final appearance. Remember, once the sealant dries, any streaks or uneven layers will be permanent.\nNow that you have thoroughly sealed your coasters, it’s time to wait for them to dry completely. Once they are fully dry, you can assemble them or use them individually as desired. The sealant will provide long-lasting protection against moisture, making your wooden coasters suitable for everyday use.\nIn summary, here are the key steps to seal your wooden coasters effectively:\nSet up a suitable workspace outdoors and protect your work surface. Shake the spray can of polyurethane sealant for a few minutes. Wear safety glasses and hold the can six to eight inches above the coaster surface. Apply the sealant in a sweeping motion, creating a thin and even layer. Allow the first side to dry completely before addressing any imperfections. Flip the coasters over and repeat the sealing process, if desired. Check for any bubbles or streaks and quickly wipe them away before the sealant dries. Wait for the coasters to dry completely before assembling or using them. By following these steps and using the best sealant for wood coasters, you can ensure that your handmade creations are well-protected and showcase a beautiful finish. Now, enjoy your coasters with confidence, knowing that they are safeguarded against moisture and designed to withstand everyday use.\n","wordCount":"603","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Steven Madden"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/best-sealant-for-wood-coasters/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Finishing Your Coasters: The Best Sealant for Wood Coasters</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 24, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;603 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Steven Madden</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ziYZqyMsm9k style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>If you&rsquo;ve recently crafted some beautiful wooden coasters, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure they are well-protected and can withstand the moisture from wet drinks.
