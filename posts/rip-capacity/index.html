In this article, we will discuss a simple method to increase the rip capacity of your table saw, allowing you to handle wider pieces of wood with ease. By following the steps outlined below, you can unlock the full potential of your contractor saw and expand its capabilities.\nStep 1: Remove the Factory Fence The first step in increasing your table saw’s rip capacity is to remove the factory fence. This will allow you to replace it with a more efficient method that will give you a greater cutting capacity.\nStep 2: Install a Ledger To enhance the rip capacity, you will need to secure a ledger to the end of the table. This ledger will serve as a guide rail and allow you to make wider cuts. It’s important to ensure that the ledger is installed parallel to the blade for accurate cuts.\nStep 3: Prepare the Ledger Milling the ledger piece to the exact dimensions of your table edge is crucial. This will ensure a flush fit and prevent any flexing or conforming to imperfections in the table’s edge. Clamp the ledger into position and drill holes to accept quarter 20 screws and nuts. Using tapered screw heads that sit flush or below the surface is recommended for a smooth installation.\nStep 4: Measure and Adjust Before making any cuts, it’s essential to measure the distance from the blade teeth to the edge of the ledger. Measure both at the front and back of the blade, and ensure both measurements are identical. If there is any variation, you can shim out one end with strips of masking tape or thin washers until the measurements are equal. Once you achieve parallel alignment, make a note of the measurement for future reference.\nStep 5: Making Wide Cuts Now that you’ve increased your table saw’s rip capacity, you can confidently make wider cuts. Start by marking the desired cutting point on the wood. If the piece exceeds your table saw’s original capacity, place the material with the good side facing down. Measure over to the desired cutting point and make an X just to the left of it.\nStep 6: Use a Straight Edge and Clamp To guide your cut, use a straight piece of material as a guide. Align it with the X mark and clamp it securely to the wood. Ensure that the guide and clamps are all on the X side of the mark.\nStep 7: Make the Cut Flip the wood over and run it through the saw, utilizing the straight edge and the table’s edge as guides. Apply pressure both forwards and towards the blade to maintain a straight and clean cut. By following this method, you can achieve precise cuts even with wider materials.\nAdditional Tips and Considerations While increasing the rip capacity of your table saw opens up new possibilities, there are a few factors to keep in mind:\nHandling large panels can be challenging, so it’s important to work within your comfort zone and avoid handling pieces that are too large for you to manage safely. Creating an outfeed table can provide additional support and make handling larger pieces more manageable. Ensure that your table saw is securely bolted down to prevent any movement during operation. Using a high-quality blade designed for the task at hand is crucial for achieving clean and accurate cuts. Regularly waxing your tabletop and outfeed table can significantly improve the smoothness of your cuts. By following these steps and considering these tips, you can maximize your table saw’s potential and tackle woodworking projects that require a greater rip capacity. Remember to prioritize safety and always work within your skill level.\nIn conclusion, by following the steps outlined in this article, you can increase the rip capacity of your table saw and unlock its full potential for woodworking projects. With the right modifications and technique, you can confidently handle wider materials and achieve precise cuts. Expand your capabilities and take your woodworking skills to the next level!\n","wordCount":"689","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Theron Shirley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/rip-capacity/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Increase the Rip Capacity of Your Table Saw for Woodworking Projects</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 27, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;689 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Theron Shirley</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#step-1-remove-the-factory-fence>Step 1: Remove the Factory Fence</a></li><li><a href=#step-2-install-a-ledger>Step 2: Install a Ledger</a></li><li><a href=#step-3-prepare-the-ledger>Step 3: Prepare the Ledger</a></li><li><a href=#step-4-measure-and-adjust>Step 4: Measure and Adjust</a></li><li><a href=#step-5-making-wide-cuts>Step 5: Making Wide Cuts</a></li><li><a href=#step-6-use-a-straight-edge-and-clamp>Step 6: Use a Straight Edge and Clamp</a></li><li><a href=#step-7-make-the-cut>Step 7: Make the Cut</a></li><li><a href=#additional-tips-and-considerations>Additional Tips and Considerations</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pp1W_HPapE4 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>If you&rsquo;re an avid woodworker, you know that having a table saw with a limited rip capacity can be quite frustrating.
