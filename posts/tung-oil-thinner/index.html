These oils not only provide a beautiful finish, but they also offer excellent water resistance. However, if applied incorrectly, they can lead to a sticky mess. In this article, we will discuss the correct way to apply oil finishes, focusing on tung oil and its application process. By following the steps outlined below, you can achieve a flawless finish every time.\nKey Points:\nUse a mixture of tung oil and citrus solvent, such as Bumblechutes, for optimal results. Apply the oil finish using a lint-free shop towel or paper towel. Spread the oil onto the wood in circular motions, driving it into the pores of the wood. Look for any dry spots and ensure the entire board has a wet look. Avoid leaving any standing material or finish pooling on the surface. Sand the board to your desired smoothness before applying the oil. Buff the surface with a dry or fresh rag to remove any excess oil. Allow at least 12 hours of dry time between coats, preferably 24 hours. For cutting boards or kitchen items, 2 to 3 coats are usually sufficient. Furniture pieces may require up to five coats for a more durable finish. Consider using 100% tung oil for a solvent-free option. Heat the oil to improve its penetration into the wood surface. Avoid using the flooding method, as it can lead to wastefulness and curing issues. Flooding method involves applying a large amount of finish and allowing the wood to soak it up. Excess oil can leach back to the surface, causing white streaks and spots. Apply coats sparingly to seal the surface without trapping excess oil in the wood. Allow sufficient cure time between coats to ensure proper polymerization of the oil. Always wipe off excess oil to avoid sticky messes. Take your time and be patient when applying oil finishes. Step-by-Step Process:\nPrepare the tung oil mixture by diluting it with citrus solvent, such as Bumblechutes, in a 50/50 ratio. Use a lint-free shop towel or paper towel to apply the oil finish onto the wood surface. Spread the oil in circular motions, ensuring it penetrates into the pores of the wood. Check for dry spots and ensure the entire board has a wet look. Avoid leaving any standing material or pooling of the finish on the surface. Sand the board to the desired smoothness, preferably up to 180 grit. Buff the surface with a dry or fresh rag to remove any excess oil. Allow the first coat to dry for at least 12 hours before applying subsequent coats. Apply additional coats using the same methodology, allowing sufficient dry time in between. For cutting boards or kitchen items, 2 to 3 coats are usually sufficient. Furniture pieces may require up to five coats for added durability. Consider using 100% tung oil for a solvent-free option, but be aware of its thicker consistency. Heat the oil to improve its penetration into the wood surface, especially with 100% tung oil. Avoid using the flooding method, which involves applying a large amount of finish and allowing the wood to soak it up. Flooding can result in wastefulness and potential curing issues. Excess oil can leach back to the surface, causing white streaks and spots. Apply coats sparingly to seal the surface without trapping excess oil in the wood. Allow sufficient cure time between coats to ensure proper polymerization of the oil. Always wipe off excess oil to avoid sticky messes. Take your time and be patient when applying oil finishes, as it is a process that requires attention to detail. By following these steps, you can ensure a successful application of oil finishes using tung oil or its mixtures. Whether you are finishing a cutting board or a piece of furniture, the key is to apply the finish sparingly, allowing it to penetrate the wood while avoiding excess buildup. With proper dry time and patience, you can achieve a flawless finish that not only enhances the beauty of the wood but also provides excellent water resistance.\nRemember, when it comes to oil finishes, patience and attention to detail are essential for a successful outcome. Take the time to understand the process and choose the right product for your project. With the correct application method and the right oil finish, you can achieve a beautiful and durable finish that will protect your wood for years to come.\nNow that you have learned the correct way to apply oil finishes, why not give it a try on your next woodworking project? With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve professional-quality results that will showcase the natural beauty of the wood. So grab your shop towel, load it up with oil, and let the finishing process begin!\n","wordCount":"805","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michelle Dean"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/tung-oil-thinner/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Obsessed Woodworking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Obsessed Woodworking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Obsessed Woodworking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://obsessedwoodworking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>A Guide to Applying Oil Finishes Correctly</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 11, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;805 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michelle Dean</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLW9f9Dw5Gg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>In recent years, natural oils have gained popularity as a safe and effective way to finish wood.
