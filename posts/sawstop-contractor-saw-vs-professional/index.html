In this article, we will explore the differences between these two types of saws and help you determine which one is the right choice for you.\nTable saws are incredibly versatile tools that can handle a wide range of tasks. From rip cuts to miters, and even complex joinery and molding work, table saws have become an essential tool for woodworkers. In fact, surveys have shown that over 97% of woodworkers own a table saw.\nSo, let’s dive deeper into the characteristics and benefits of both contractor saws and cabinet saws.\nCabinet Saw Cabinet saws, such as the professional cabinet saw from SawStop, are known for their sturdy construction and durability. These saws feature fully enclosed cabinets, which provide added stability and reduce noise levels. The motors on cabinet saws are typically three horsepower or larger, delivering plenty of power for even the toughest cutting tasks.\nOne of the standout features of cabinet saws is their robust trunnion and drive system, which is mounted inside the cabinet. The top of the saw is usually made of a substantial slab of cast iron, ensuring a flat surface for precise cuts. Additionally, cabinet saws come with high-quality fences and effective dust containment systems. SawStop’s professional cabinet saws also incorporate their renowned safety technology, making them the safest in the industry.\nWhile the quality and performance of cabinet saws are undeniable, they do come at a higher price point. For most woodworkers who have the budget and space, a cabinet saw is the go-to choice.\nContractor Saw Contractor saws, on the other hand, are designed with portability in mind. They were originally created for use on construction sites, where mobility is essential. These saws are lighter and do not have an enclosed cabinet. The motors on contractor saws, like the SawStop contractor saw, typically have 1.75 horsepower.\nThe trunnion on a contractor saw is mounted to the table instead of the cabinet. While older models may have stamped metal tables, modern contractor saws often feature a cast iron section in the middle of the top. Fences can vary from aluminum extrusion to high-quality T-glide fences.\nContractor saws offer a more affordable option without compromising on performance. Many professional woodworkers, including the speaker in the video, have chosen contractor saws for their shops. With the addition of an extended table and fence, contractor saws can handle a wide range of woodworking tasks.\nCustomization and Features SawStop’s contractor saws, including the one featured in the video, offer a high level of customization. This allows woodworkers to tailor the saw to their specific needs. Additionally, all SawStop saws come with their safety technology, which is a major advantage for woodworkers concerned about their well-being.\nIn terms of additional features and add-ons, SawStop pays great attention to detail. The instructions and component packaging are top-notch, making assembly and setup hassle-free. The mobile base, although an optional accessory, is of exceptional quality. And, of course, the braking technology employed by SawStop is a standout feature, providing added safety and peace of mind.\nThe overall build quality, from the robust mounting system of the legs to the attention to detail in every component, is a testament to SawStop’s commitment to delivering top-of-the-line saws.\nConclusion Choosing between a contractor saw and a cabinet saw ultimately depends on your woodworking needs, budget, and available space. Both types of saws offer exceptional performance and quality. Cabinet saws are ideal for those who prioritize power, durability, and the added safety features of SawStop’s technology. Contractor saws, on the other hand, provide a more portable and budget-friendly option without sacrificing performance.\nRegardless of which saw you choose, investing in a high-quality table saw like those offered by SawStop will undoubtedly enhance your woodworking capabilities and make your projects more enjoyable and efficient.\nSo, evaluate your needs, consider your budget, and make an informed decision based on the information provided in this article. Remember, a table saw is an investment that can greatly impact the quality and efficiency of your woodworking endeavors.
